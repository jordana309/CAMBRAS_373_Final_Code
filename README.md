# CAMBRAS_373_Final_Code
Code for team CAMBRAS's 373 final project.

This project contains the C++ and Matlab code needed to run our analytical methods for our final project for 373.

According to our presenation ( https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DoR7SGDU5Wz3oFg5slsvY2NPQTnPTHDerD39LFcHqiI ),
we have decided to break out the categories in the following ways:
1. Power consumption - Shaun
  ie appliances, TV time, etc
2. Power generation - Jordan
  What, where, how much, waste and dangers
3. Personal investment effects - Peter
  ie install solar cells, geothermal heating/cooling, etc.
4. Personal reduction of consumption strategies/effects - Michael (I can do something else if someone else already picked this)
  turning out lights, not watering lawn, reducing driving distance, etc.
5. Water consumption
  
6. Governmental savings related to Power Generation - Debora Lyn
  
7. Something else
  

If you have any questions, or need any help, lets talk about it.
