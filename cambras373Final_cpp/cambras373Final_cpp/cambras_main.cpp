/* Explaination for group members:
 * This is our C++ main program. Classes, other functions should be included in headers.
 * The includes: - classes, in alphabetical order
                 - headers/libraries, in alphabetical order
                 - summary of all functions. Please follow the layout for those
                 - our main function
 * I try to keep the program lines shorter than 100 total characters. To help with this, I use two
   spaces instead of tabs (you can set tab width in Tools-->Options, Text Editor->C/C++->Tabs). 
 * If you have any questions about how to use GitHub or anything else, just let me know, and I'll
   do my best to help you out! */
