/* Import real data: Imports the coefficients for the real data that were exported by the matlab
   code. As this was saved out to different files, this requires reading in different files.
 * Args: pop-a matrix to hold the population coefficients (51x4 matrix)
         gen-a matrix to hold the generation coefficients (51x64 matrix)
         cost-a matrix to hold the cost coefficients (51xX matrix)
 * Coder: Jordan Argyle
 * Use: Just pass in the variables that you want to hold the coefficients. It should be a matrix. */
